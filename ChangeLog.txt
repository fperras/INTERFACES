-Bug Fixes
	-Fixed a bug that caused the innacurate calculation of distances in cases where there are 2 detected spins.
	-Fixed a problem with the parallelism.
-New Features
	-Added the ability to circumvent the Gaussian distribution model of the detected nuclei's distance distribution.
	 With this new mode the dephasing and chi^2 are calculated on-the-fly as the average dephasing for all detected
         nuclei. This operation adds some additional overhead and is thus considerably slower, but more accurate. To use
         this mode, the keyword 'meticulous' should be added to the input file.
